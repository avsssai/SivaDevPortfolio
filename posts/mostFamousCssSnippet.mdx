excerpt: Easiest way to make responsive containers using CSS grid.

CSS Grid has become a game changer ever since it's been introduced in CSS.

It is the defacto CSS algorithm to position elements in a 2D layout.

I know I know, before you pick up your pitchforks or worse - close this tab. I shall mention Flexbox.

Flexbox is an excellent tool which has the capacity to render elements when we take a 2D layout problem, but it is limited. It is limited cause we have to consider
both the axes to make it work and then some.

(The combination of Flexbox for Grid is the sweet mid point for fine grained control in both 2D and respective 1D in those 2D layouts.)

Pardon the rabbit hole, onto the topic at hand.

That's right, Easy responsive containers with CSS grid.

We relied heavily on media queries to write responsive queries, let's look at a use case for better understanding.

_The problem_

Suppose we have a layout where there are a set of cards, and we wanna write some css logic so that they automatically grow and shrik with the screen size.

let's first do it this with **media querie**, without using any CSS grid.
