This blog has been a long time coming.

I have read in numerous places that you don't need to build a blog to start blogging, **which is absolutely true**.

**_But_** Having a small corner on the internet which you can call yours is always a great feeling.

This will be the space where I will document what I already know and whatever knowledge I will acquire further.

This is a virtual locker of my learnings, which I can visit often to check on stuff.

If this helps anyone else too that is absolutely great!

## About this site -

This site was constructed using [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/) (I absolutely love the developer experience!).

If you haven't check out their docs and the [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=homepage-cta&utm_campaign=next-website), it's amazing. Truly one of the best documentations I have read.

I have done the theming for the site myself, picked a few colors I like.

The fonts used are Montserrat and Merriweather ðŸ’œ

I will write a blog in the coming days about how to make the flickerless dark theme on Next Js, which was inspired by Josh Comeau's [article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/) on how to do it in Gatsby.

If you wanna check the code for that meanwhile, I have made a [template](https://github.com/avsssai/nextJs-darkmode-flickerless-template) for the same.

This a great start and I am sure I will keep expanding this further!

Till next time. ðŸ‘‹
